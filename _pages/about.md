Hello! ä½ å¥½! ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹ 

Welcome to my first website and personal landing page! 

<div style="text-align: justify">
Presently, I am a student at the University of Cambridge, reading machine learning and machine intelligence! I have worn many hats, from software engineer to management consultant to biomedical research scientist. 
</div>

> In all my experiences, I found myself most productive (and intellectually stimulated) when solving **meaningful challenges** that can **positively impact others.** 

<div style="text-align: justify">
 How I envision myself achieving this goal, currently, is through engineering biomedical devices that can help individuals with neurological disorders overcome their disabilities. In line with this goal, I am pursuing research opportunities in the fields of <u>machine learning</u>, <u>brain-machine interfaces</u>, <u>neural prostheses</u> as well as <u>neuromorphic computing</u> paradigms.

<div style="text-align: justify">
For my undergraduate studies, I studied a double degree of B.Eng. Honours in Electrical Engineering and B.Com. in Business Analytics at the University of Sydney, where I was awarded the University Medal. My undergraduate thesis, which was on deep learning based diagnosis of epilepsy, was <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9055195">published.</a>
