Hello! ä½ å¥½! ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my first website and my personal landing page!

I am Tennison, a student at the University of Cambridge, studying a degree in machine learning and machine intelligence! I have worn many hats, from software engineer to management consultant to biomedical research scientist. 

**Throughout my endeavours, I am driven by the desire to solve meaningful challenges and affect positive impact.**

Presently, how I envision myself achieving that goal is through engineering biomedical devices that can help individuals with neurological disorders to overcome their disabilities. In line with this goal, I am pursuing research opportunities in the fields of <u>machine learning</u>, <u>brain-machine interfaces</u>, <u>neural prostheses</u> as well as <u>neuromorphic computing</u> paradigms. 

For my undergraduate studies, I studied a double degree of B.Eng Honours in Electrical Engineering and B.Com in Business Analytics at the University of Sydney, where I was awarded the University Medal. My undergraduate thesis, which was on deep learning based diagnosis of epilepsy, was [published](http://example.com).
